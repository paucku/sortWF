## Sort WorkFlowy
- Zoom on a bullet.
- Activate the bookmarklet or use the userscript shortcut *Ctrl+Shft+S*.
- A prompt appears with 2 sorting buttons: *A-Z* and *Z-A*.
- Only the zoom level children get sorted.
- Grandchildren stay with their parents, but are not sorted.
- Completed children are sorted, even when hidden.
- After sorting is complete, a message confirms the sort.
- Undo the sort using WorkFlowy's standard undo feature.
- For transparency, the bookmarklet will not sort if search is active.
- To limit the load on WorkFlowy's servers, the maximum number of children that can be sorted is 400.
